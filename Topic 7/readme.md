After submission, I checked the albums page and there is the added album.

Summary of features added:

In this part of the activity, we added a new component to add albums to our application. We utilized states to set the values from the text fields and then upon pressing the submit button, it then "posted" into the datasource connection. I had troubles as I kept getting errors that it could not read title in the back end. After going through the code and fixing an error, the add Album worked as intended.

Part 7: Edit an Album:

ScreenShots:

Here is the edit album form with an album selected.

![Alt text](<Screenshot 2023-08-13 at 1.40.31 PM.png>)

Here you can see that I added (edited) to test/show that it worked.

![Alt text](<Screenshot 2023-08-13 at 1.40.47 PM.png>)

Here is the same edited album after submission. Take note of the (edited) that we added in the form.

Summary of features:

In this part, we combined the edit album with the new album so that the forms could be used in tandem. I did not continue to do the tracks as it would need to be integrated within the add album portion. All functions are working as they should.
