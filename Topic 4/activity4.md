**Research:**

Research how an Angular application maintains a logged in state. How does it communicate this state to the server?

Angular applications maintain a logged-in state through an authentication mechanism, often using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for token-based authentication. Angular applications can maintain a logged-in state for users, securely communicate this state to the server using JSON Web Tokens, and ensure that only authenticated users access protected resources and perform authorized actions on the server.
